## Use Cases & Examples

### Use Case 1: Business Class Trip to Tokyo

**Scenario:** A traveler wants to fly business class from New York to Tokyo and has points across multiple programs: 120,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points, 80,000 American Express Membership Rewards points, and 50,000 United MileagePlus miles.

**How Award Compass Helps:**
1. The user enters JFK-HND, selects business class, and inputs their program balances.
2. Award Compass identifies a high-value "sweet spot" redemption: Virgin Atlantic Flying Club for ANA flights.
3. The system shows that transferring 90,000 points from Chase to Virgin Atlantic provides a business class round-trip worth $6,200 (6.9¢ per point value).
4. Award Compass provides detailed booking instructions, noting that this redemption requires calling Virgin Atlantic's service center and highlights that seats become available 330 days before departure.
5. The AI insight compares this to alternatives like using United miles directly (150,000 miles for the same route at 4.1¢ per point) or transferring to ANA directly (requiring 85,000 points but with higher fees).

**Results:** The traveler saves 60,000 points compared to booking through United and gets a higher quality product with lower fees, realizing over $1,500 in additional value.

### Use Case 2: Family Resort Vacation

**Scenario:** A family of four needs five nights at a luxury resort in Hawaii. They have 200,000 Marriott Bonvoy points, 100,000 Hilton Honors points, and 90,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards points.

**How Award Compass Helps:**
1. The user enters their destination, dates, and points balances.
2. Award Compass evaluates all options and identifies two optimal paths:
   - Direct booking with Marriott: 240,000 points for five nights (with fifth night free benefit), valued at $2,000 (0.83¢ per point).
   - Transferring Chase points to Hyatt: 120,000 points for five nights at a comparable property, valued at $2,500 (2.1¢ per point).
3. The system highlights that the Hyatt option delivers significantly better value per point and preserves Marriott points for future use.
4. Award Compass provides specific booking guidance, noting blackout dates to avoid and suggesting booking at least 6 months in advance for best availability.

**Results:** The family saves 120,000 Marriott points while securing comparable accommodations, effectively doubling the value of their points through the optimal transfer program.

### Use Case 3: Last-Minute Weekend Getaway

**Scenario:** A traveler wants to book a last-minute weekend trip from Chicago to Miami but cash prices are very high ($750 round-trip in economy). They have 30,000 Delta SkyMiles, 40,000 American Express points, and 25,000 American Airlines miles.

**How Award Compass Helps:**
1. The user enters ORD-MIA with dates just two weeks away.
2. Award Compass searches across all programs and identifies available award space on American Airlines for 20,000 miles round-trip.
3. The system calculates a value of 3.75¢ per point (excellent for economy redemptions).
4. Award Compass flags that Delta is charging 45,000 miles for the same dates, demonstrating the price difference between programs.
5. The booking guidance includes tips for finding and securing last-minute award space, including checking for increased availability 24-48 hours before departure.

**Results:** The traveler books a trip that would have cost $750 using only 20,000 miles, saving both cash and avoiding the poor-value Delta redemption that would have cost more than twice the miles for the same trip.

## Value Calculation Methodology

Award Compass uses several key calculations to quantify the value of redemption options and help users make objective comparisons:

### Cents Per Point (CPP) Calculation

The core metric used to evaluate redemptions is cents per point (CPP), calculated as:

```
CPP = (Cash Value of Redemption in $ × 100) ÷ (Number of Points Required)
```

For example:
- Business class flight costs $4,000 or 100,000 points
- CPP = (4,000 × 100) ÷ 100,000 = 4.0¢ per point

The system factors in these components:
- **Base Cash Value**: Market rate for the same flight/hotel in cash
- **Points Required**: Total points needed, including any transfer conversions
- **Fees and Surcharges**: Subtracted from the cash value to determine net value

### Transfer Partner Value Analysis

When evaluating transfer options, the system calculates:

```
Effective CPP = (Cash Value × 100) ÷ (Source Points Required ÷ Transfer Ratio)
```

For example:
- 1,000 Chase points convert to 1,500 Hyatt points (1:1.5 ratio)
- Room costs $300 or 15,000 Hyatt points
- Effective CPP = (300 × 100) ÷ (15,000 ÷ 1.5) = 3.0¢ per Chase point

### Sweet Spot Identification

Award Compass identifies "sweet spots" using these criteria:
- CPP value exceeds program baseline by 50%+ (e.g., >2.25¢ for a program with 1.5¢ baseline)
- Special routing rules or partner redemptions that offer outsized value
- Fifth night free or similar program-specific benefits
- Peak vs. off-peak pricing opportunities

### Opportunity Cost Assessment

The system also evaluates opportunity cost using:

```
Opportunity Cost = Points Used × Baseline Value of Points in Program
```

This helps users determine if using points makes sense compared to paying cash, particularly for low-CPP redemptions.

### Award Availability Weighting

Redemption options are weighted by practical factors:
- Seasonal availability patterns
- Number of available partner airlines
- Frequency of routes and flights
- Historical ease of finding award space

These calculations ensure users get the most comprehensive picture of their redemption options, balancing pure mathematical value with practical considerations about availability and ease of booking.

## Technical Foundation

The application uses a sophisticated calculation engine that combines:
- Award chart data for various loyalty programs
- Transfer partner relationships and ratios
- Real-time award availability checking
- Value-based comparison algorithms
- AI-powered analysis and recommendation generation

Award Compass aims to demystify the complex world of loyalty program redemptions, helping travelers extract maximum value from their hard-earned points and miles.
